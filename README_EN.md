# About Me

After an unconventional career path, I decided to transition into software programming.  
I completed a certification program in Java backend programming—a mature language that lets me tackle stimulating challenges.

I am currently seeking a developer position in the greater Montreal area or remote.

In the meantime, I am developing management and decision-support software for a client in the agri-food sector (manufacturing and wholesale).

# The Project

**Problems to Solve**

- Read .xlsx documents and store them in a relational database (wholesale sales, retail sales, product sheets).
- Create a REST API that exposes endpoints to allow the frontend to make requests and display data visualizations for users.

**Backend** - [Repository](https://github.com/Scud-P/cgnial/tree/REST)

- Programming Language: Java 17
- Framework: Spring
- Build & Packaging: Maven

**Frontend** - [Repository](https://github.com/Scud-P/cgnialFront)

- Programming Languages: HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Libraries: React/Bootstrap/Axios/ChartJS

# My Training

I completed a full-time one-year program provided by [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/). I now hold a [Level 6 Professional Certification in Software Development, recognized by the French government.](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/38038/)

Guided by a mentor, I completed nine hands-on projects, learning the language and all the technologies that orbit around it: popular frameworks, useful libraries, databases, testing, debugging, continuous integration pipelines, concurrency, containerization, and more. The vastness of the knowledge to acquire did not discourage me; I’m far from mastering it all, but that’s what I enjoy—the continuous learning of new technologies in a constantly evolving landscape.
